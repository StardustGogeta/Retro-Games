# Retro Games
This is a sample of some classic / retro games written in C.

## Windows Setup
To get this project working on Windows, use the project file retro_win32.cbp for editing or building.
The SDL2 library is required for running this, and the .DLL file must be placed in the same directory as the .EXE file.
Install this library in the folder C:\\MinGW, or the project file will need to be edited.
**Make sure to use the 32-bit version, as the 64-bit version will create errors!**
